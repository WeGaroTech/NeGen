# NEGen  
### Indigenous Language AI Assistant for North-East India

NEGen is a domain-focused Generative AI assistant designed to improve access to public information for communities in North-East India by reducing language and information barriers.

The system provides conversational explanations for government services, education guidance, and basic health awareness using a responsible, constrained AI approach.

## Problem Statement

Public information in North-East India is primarily available in English or Hindi.  
This creates accessibility barriers for indigenous and tribal communities, especially in rural regions.

As a result:
- Awareness of government schemes remains low
- Eligibility and benefits are often misunderstood
- Education and career guidance is hard to access
- Health awareness information does not reach people effectively

Most existing solutions rely on static content and do not support interactive explanations or follow-up questions.

## Solution Overview

NEGen provides a conversational AI interface that explains verified public information in a simple, guided manner.

The system is intentionally **domain-constrained** to ensure accuracy, safety, and trust.

### Supported Domains
- **Government** – Scheme information, eligibility, benefits, documents, and application steps
- **Education** – Career guidance, learning pathways, and concept explanations
- **Health** – Basic health awareness and advisory information (non-diagnostic)

## Key Design Principles

- Indigenous-language-first architecture
- Verified and curated data sources
- Conversational explanations instead of static text
- Responsible AI with strict scope boundaries
- Modular and future-ready system design
